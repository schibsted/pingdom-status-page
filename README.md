# Pingdom Status Page

A status page that displays your current and historical uptime from [Pingdom](https://pingdom.com).
See it in action at [vgstatus.no](https://vgstatus.no).

## Getting started

First, set `PINGDOM_API_KEY` to your [Pingdom API key](https://my.pingdom.com/app/api-tokens). To 
start the server, run `$ yarn dev` for development or `$ yarn start` for production. Then open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see it.

To sync with Pingdom, run `$ yarn run update`.

## Configuration

Configure your checks in `config.json`:

```javascript
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "id": 4574685, // The check ID on Pingdom (find it by opening it in Pingdom and looking in the URL)
      "name": "VG Front page" // Whatever you want it to be listed as on your status page
    },
    {
      "id": 6420183,
      "name": "VG Articles"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (that we made up)

#### There are a lot of open source status pages. How is this different?

There are a lot of open source status pages out there, but they're mostly manually updated
and can't show ~off~ your historical uptime. We could only find one other open source
status page ([Statping](https://github.com/statping/statping)) which actually measures uptime,
but if you're already using Pingdom then this is simpler.

## Deployment

Pingdom Status Page only needs NodeJS to run. It's important to us that it runs anywhere, so
it's easy to set up in an environment that preferably _isn't the one you're monitoring_.

#### systemd

Here's a handy systemd file to run it:

```
[Unit]
Description=Pingdom Status Page

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/yarn start -p 80
StandardOutput=file:/path/to/your/stdout.log
StandardError=file:/path/to/your/stderr.log
Restart=always
Environment=PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/the/code

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### crontab

Here's a handy crontab to sync with Pingdom every minute and log it to a file:

```crontab
* * * * * (cd /path/to/the/code && . /path/to/the/code/.envrc && /usr/bin/yarn update) > /path/to/your/log 2>&1
```
